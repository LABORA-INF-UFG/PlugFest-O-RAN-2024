## FAQ

**1. Why do we install modified versions of VespaMgr on the Near-RT RIC❓**
   <p align="justify">
   The default configurations available in the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) for these components are inadequate for our specific requirements. The standard versions of VespaMgr lack the flexibility and customization options necessary for our deployment. Here are the key reasons:
   </p>
   
   - Configuration Flexibility:
      - <p align="justify"> VespaMgr's default settings do not allow dynamic configuration changes. For example, the URL of the VES collector is hardcoded and cannot be modified through configuration files like ConfigMap.
      - Similarly, the queries for data retrieval from Prometheus are not configurable, which limits our ability to tailor the system to our needs.
        </p>
        
   - Increased Data Handling Capacity:
      - <p align="justify"> We had to increase the maximum size of HTTP requests supported by VespaMgr from 2,000,000 bytes to 10,000,000 bytes. This adjustment was essential to accommodate the larger volume of data generated by our queries. </p>
      - <p align="justify"> These modifications ensure that the Near-RT RIC can function effectively within our infrastructure, addressing the limitations of the standard OSC versions.

**2. Why do we install modified versions of the A1 Mediator on the Near-RT RIC❓**
   <p align="justify">
   The current release of the Non-RT RIC does not support version 2 of the A1 API and only supports version 1. Additionally, the last of the A1 mediator image with version 1 of the A1 API had a bug in the RMR message, where policy instances were sent without the subId (policy subscription identification), and due to this, policy instances do not arrive correctly on xApps. Our modified version addresses this issue by ensuring policy instances include the necessary ID. This modification is crucial for maintaining proper functionality and integration within our RIC infrastructure.
   </p>

**3. Why do we need to install a tool to store the non-RT RIC components❓**
   <p align="justify">
   By default, Kubernetes does not provide a storage class essential for enabling pods to utilize persistent storage. The "RECIPE_EXAMPLE/example_recipe.yaml" file recommends using a storage class to address this persistence. The Local Path Provisioner from Rancher is particularly advantageous due to its ease of use and straightforward deployment. This provisioner allows us to efficiently configure persistent storage for our Kubernetes pods, ensuring reliable and consistent storage management for the Non-RT RIC components.
   </p>


**4. Was the modification of the Policy Management Service only to find the address of the A1 Mediator from the previous step❓**
   <p align="justify">
      In integrating the Near-RT RIC with the Non-RT RIC, it is necessary to inform the Non-RT RIC of the address of the A1 service to the Near-RT RIC that will be connected. The Policy Management Service was modified to locate and connect to the A1 Mediator's address, facilitating seamless communication and integration between the Near-RT and Non-RT RIC components. This modification ensures that policy management can effectively coordinate across the RIC layers.

**5. Are the VesCollector, Kafka, Prometheus-Blackbox-Exporter, InfluxDB, Chronograf, and InfluxDB-Connector all vanilla components of the SMO❓ Is there anything outside of what comes with the SMO, and is this all we need❓**
   <p align="justify">
      The SMO components from O-RAN SC are deprecated, with the latest version being 0.1.0. They do not support all types of messages defined by the VES API. Additionally, the SMO from ONAP is large, complex, and challenging to integrate with the VespaMgr of the Near-RT RIC from O-RAN SC. 
To overcome these limitations, we developed our own VesCollector and InfluxDBConnector, following the patterns of the SMO from O-RAN. This customized approach allows us to meet our specific requirements more effectively. Alongside these components, we use Kafka (as a data river), Prometheus-Blackbox-Exporter, InfluxDB (as a data lake), and Chronograf. They are essential for our operational needs. If this set of components suffices, a tailored recipe or an override YAML with these components can be created to streamline deployment and integration.
