## FAQ

- **Why do we install modified versions of VespaMgr on the Near-RT RIC‚ùì**
   <p align="justify">
      The default configurations available in the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) for these components are inadequate for our specific requirements. The standard versions of VespaMgr lack the flexibility and customization options necessary for our deployment. Here are the key reasons:
      - Configuration Flexibility:
      VespaMgr's default settings do not allow dynamic configuration changes. For example, the URL of the VES collector is hardcoded and cannot be modified through configuration files like ConfigMap. Similarly, the queries for data retrieval from Prometheus are not configurable, which limits our ability to tailor the system to our needs.
      - Increased Data Handling Capacity:
      We had to increase the maximum size of HTTP requests supported by VespaMgr from 2,000,000 bytes to 10,000,000 bytes. This adjustment was essential to accommodate the larger volume of data generated by our queries.
      These modifications ensure that the Near-RT RIC can function effectively within our infrastructure, addressing the limitations present in the standard OSC versions.
